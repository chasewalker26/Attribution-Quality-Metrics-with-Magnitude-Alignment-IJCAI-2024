# Attribution Quality Metrics with Magnitude Alignment
The official implementation of "Attribution Quality Metrics with Magnitude Alignment" published in IJCAI 2024

## Datasets
Place the ImageNet and RESISC45 datasets in the project root folder.

RESISC45 download: `https://1drv.ms/u/s!AmgKYzARBl5ca3HNaHIlzp_IXjs`

## How to Use the Magnitude Aligned Scoring (MAS) Metric on Attributions
See example.ipynb for a full example of the application of the MAS source code for multiple attributions.

Also included in the notebook are the PIC and RISE metrics.

## Replicating the Paper Experiments
To replicate the paper experiments, please see the README inside of the `MAS/experiments` folder.

All experimental data reported in the paper was generated by these tests and the commands in the README.

The test results are visible in `MAS/test_results`, `MAS/noise_ignorance`, and `MAS/sensitivity_test_grapher.ipynb`.
